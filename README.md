## Purpose and Functionality

Project specific interfaces to REMIND / MAgPIE.

# Tutorial

To improve the tutorial, edit [`tutorial.md`](./tutorial.md).

- To understand how to submit to the IIASA database, read this
  [REMIND tutorial](https://github.com/remindmodel/remind/blob/develop/tutorials/13_Submit_to_IIASA_database.md).
- In the following, we differentiate templates (list of variables and corresponding units used in a project)
  and mappings (specifying which PIAM variable will be mapped to a project variable).

## Mappings

Mappings found in
the [`inst/mappings`](https://github.com/pik-piam/piamInterfaces/tree/master/inst/mappings) folder
serve to map variables from the PIAM framework to variables needed for the submission to databases.
The mappings are `;`-separated files, using `#` as comment character, with the following mandatory columns:

- `variable`: name of the variable in the project template
- `unit`: unit corresponding to `variable`. If the IIASA template has no unit, use `unitless`: an empty cell will fail the tests to avoid unintentially forgetting units.
- `piam_variable`: name of the variable in REMIND / MAgPIE / EDGE-T etc. reporting. Please use `|+|` notation and try to remain consistent with a REMIND mif to facilitate debugging for humans, but from a technical point of view it is completely irrelevant. You can use [`updatePlusUnit()`](./R/updatePlusUnit.R) to update the correct `|+|` spelling and the unit based on a model data file.
- `piam_unit`: unit corresponding to `piam_variable`
- `piam_factor`: factor with which the `piam_variable` has to be multiplied for units to match

Recommended columns:
- `description`: description text defining the `variable`. Never use `"` and `;` in the text.
- `source`: abbreviation of the PIAM part where the `piam_variable` comes from.
  Use `B` = Brick, `C` = MAGICC, `M` = MAgPIE, `R` = REMIND, `S` = SDP postprocessing, `T` = EDGE-Transport.
  This column is used to select the variables passed to
  [remind2](https://github.com/pik-piam/remind2/blob/master/tests/testthat/test-convGDX2mif.R)
  and [coupling tests](https://github.com/remindmodel/remind/blob/develop/tests/testthat/test_20-coupled.R).
  If the variable is not normally reported, add a small `x` after the model abbreviation for it to be skipped in those tests.
  New source abbreviations should be explained here and must be added to [`inst/sources.csv`](./inst/sources.csv).

Additionally, some mappings use those columns:
- `idx`: serial number of `variable`
- `tier`: importance of variable, with 1 being most important
- `comment`: place for internal comments
- `interpolation`: sets the interpolation method for the `variable` (i.e. not `piam_variable`) (currently only supports `linear`). When set to `linear`, adds yearly values between 2005 and 2100 through linear interpolation for the selected output variables.
- `weight`: calculates a weighted average of multiple entries of `piam_variable`. Provide a different `piam_variable` in this column, and `generateIIASASubmission()` will split the data on the rows which contain weight pointers, resolve these weights into numerical values (via a join operation between the submission and the input data) and then modify the value based on the weighting. This takes place in the private .resolveWeights method.

### Editing a mapping

You can use a text editor, `R` or a spreadsheet editor to adjust the mappings.

For `R`, use:
```
mappingdata <- getMapping("AR6")
... whatever data.frame operations you want ...
writeMapping(mappingdata, "inst/mappings/mapping_yourproject.csv")
```

Using `Excel` can be problematic, as it sometimes changes values and quotation marks, depending on how it is set up. 
You can easily check if your setup poses problems by opening one of the mappings in excel, changing a line, saving it, and then running `git diff`. If only your changes in the one line are shown/marked (instead of eg all lines being displayed with changed separators or so), all is fine and you can use excel to adjust the mapping.  

For `LibreOffice Calc`, use these settings:
```
Text Import:
  - Character set: Unicode (UTF-8)
  - Separated by: Semicolon.
Save -> Edit filter settings:
  - Character set: Unicode (UTF-8)
  - Field Delimiter: ;
  - String Delimiter: (none)
```

The github diff on a large semicolon-separated file is often unreadable.
For a human-readable output, save the old version of the mapping and run:
```
remind2::compareScenConf(fileList = c("oldfile.csv", "mappingfile.csv"), row.names = NULL, expanddata = FALSE)
```
On the PIK cluster, you can run `comparescenconf mapping_AR6.csv` in the `inst/mappings` folder and it will compare to a recent `master` version.

After you adjusted the mapping, run `make test` on Linux (incl. the cluster) or `Rscript -e 'devtools::test(show_report = TRUE)'` on Windows, and various tests will be performed.

### Renaming a piam_variable

If a variable used as `piam_variable` has to be renamed, please add it with its `old_name` to [`inst/renamed_piam_variables.csv`](./inst/renamed_piam_variables.csv).
Like this, if someone arrives with a dataset that contains the old name but not the new, [`renameOldVariables()`](./R/renameOldVariables.R) makes sure the data is automatically adjusted.
[`test-renameOldVariables.R`](./tests/testthat/test-renameOldVariables.R) enforces that the old variable name is not used anywhere in the mappings.
To adjust the mappings automatically, make sure you commit the current state to be able to reset its results, and then run `Rscript -e "devtools::load_all(); renameOldInMappings()"`.
Check the `diff` carefully, for example using `comparescenconf`, see above.

### piam_factor and unit checks

While running the tests, an extensive check of the compatibility of `piam_unit`, `unit` and `piam_factor` is performed in each mapping.
It helps to find mismatches, for example mapping `Mt` to `Gt` with a factor of `1` or mapping `US$2005` to `US$2017` without accounting for inflation.
These checks are performed using [`checkUnitFactor()`](./R/checkUnitFactor.R).
It first calls [`areUnitsIdentical()`](./R/areUnitsIdentical.R) where a number of identical units are specified (such as `Mt CO2` = `Mt CO2eq`, where `piam_factor` is 1).
Then, `checkUnitFactor()` compares a list of accepted factors against the mappings.
In case your tests fails, carefully check whether the `piam_factor` is correct, and if you a certain, add it to one of the functions so it will be accepted.

### Price indices

While running `generateIIASASubmission()`, if `Price|*|Index` variables are part of the `iiasatemplate` and `Price|*` is part of the data, the missing price indices will be calculated automatically by [`priceIndicesIIASA()`](./R/priceIndicesIIASA.R). Price indices with wrong reference year (the year where the index is 1) are corrected automatically by [`priceIndicesFix()`](./R/priceIndicesFix.R).

### Creating a new mapping

First consider whether you need a new mapping or whether we can reduce redundancy.
For example, if your project just uses a subset of an established mapping, using that mapping together with `iiasatemplate` to filter automatically just the variables you need is sufficient.
If you additionally need some project-specific variables, create a mapping with just those and combine the mappings for submission, for example calling `mapping = c("ScenarioMIP", "PRISMA")`.

If you need to set up a new mapping: Since templates contain between several hundreds and a few thousand variables, relying on existing mappings can save substantial amounts of work compared to setting up a new mapping from scratch. Since the template itself is most likely built based on earlier templates from other projects, chances are good that existing mappings already provide parts of the required new mapping. Using `R`, we describe a simple way to create a new mapping `mapping_NEW.csv` based on existing mappings.

1. Identify which existing mappings are most relevant for your new mapping. Criteria might include the time at which the existing mapping was created and the proximity of the templates (e.g. follow-up project). If you are unsure, ask your experienced colleagues for advice. This provides you with a list of existing mappings that is ordered by relevance, say `mapping_OLD1.csv`, ... , `mapping_OLD9.csv`.
2. Use `read.csv2` to get the template as a dataframe `template`.
3. Looping over the existing mappings in descending order of relevance,
    - use `getMapping` to get the existing mapping `mapping_OLDi` as a dataframe,
    - `filter` `mapping_OLDi` for variables which are contained in `template` and which have not yet been added to `mapping_NEW`,
    - `left_join` (by variable) the filtered `mapping_OLDi` with `template`  to add the information from the template (consider using `str_to_lower` for case-insensitive matching when filtering and joining),
    - `select`/`mutate` the columns of the joined dataframe to keep the desired columns for the new mapping (see above for description of mandatory and recommended columns),
    - `bind_rows` to `mapping_NEW`
5. Use `writeMapping()` to export `mapping_NEW` as `mapping_NEW.csv`. It is recommended to make a few checks (e.g. by looking at all variables for which the description or the unit does not agree between the existing mapping and the template).

## Summation checks

Templates often have a structure where some 'parent' variable has to be the sum of its 'childs', such as `Emissions|CO|Energy ` = `Emissions|CO|Energy|Demand` + `Emissions|CO|Energy|Supply`.
This can be checked using summation files that are placed in the [`inst/summations`](https://github.com/pik-piam/piamInterfaces/tree/master/inst/summations) folder.
The first column contains the parent, the second all its childs. If you want further groups for a single parent, use `Emissions|CO2|Energy 2` etc. with a single-digit number.
The [`checkSummations()`](./R/checkSummations.R) function allows to check your data based on a summation file and a mapping, for example like this:
```
d <- generateIIASASubmission("remind.mif", mapping = "ScenarioMIP", outputDirectory = NULL, checkSummation = FALSE)
checkSummations(d, template = "ScenarioMIP", summationsFile = "ScenarioMIP", outputDirectory = NULL)
```
You can also simply pass a IIASA snapshot xlsx or csv file to checkSummations.

A starting point for a new summation file based on a mapping can be generated like this:
```
library(tidyverse); library(piamInterfaces)
vars <- grep("^Lifetime|^Price|^OM Cost|^Capital Cost", unique(piamInterfaces::getMapping("ScenarioMIP")$variable), invert = TRUE, value = TRUE)
liste <- mip::extractVariableGroups(vars)
tbl <- tibble()
for (l in sort(names(liste))) {
  childs <- grep("\\*$", liste[[l]], invert = TRUE, value = TRUE)
  if (length(childs) > 1) {
    tbl <- rbind(tbl, tibble(parent = l, child = childs, factor = 1), tibble(parent = "", child = "", factor = ""))
  }
}
writeMapping(tbl, "summation_group_ScenarioMIP.csv")
```
This will put all childs into a single summation group, so you will have to split them up when needed and remove some nonsensical ones.

In REMIND, summation checks can be performed automatically after every run if added to [`checkProjectSummations.R`](https://github.com/remindmodel/remind/blob/develop/scripts/output/single/checkProjectSummations.R).

## Model intercomparison plots

- To compare the results of different models, pass as `modeldata` a [quitte](https://github.com/pik-piam/quitte/) object or a csv/xlsx file.
You get a PDF document for each scenario and each model with area plots for all the summation groups in `AR6` (or `NAVIGATE`) [summation files](https://github.com/pik-piam/piamInterfaces/tree/master/inst/summations) plus line plots for each variable in the `lineplotVariables` vector you supplied. It takes some time, better use a `slurm` job for:
  ```
  plotIntercomparison(modeldata, summationsFile = "AR6", lineplotVariables = c("Temperature|Global Mean", "Population"))
  ```

- If your `modeldata` is not well filtered such that for example model regions are not too different, you can use `interactive = TRUE` which allows to select models, regions, scenarios and variables that you like in your PDF. As `lineplotVariables`, you can also specify mapping names.
  ```
  plotIntercomparison(modeldata, summationsFile = "AR6", lineplotVariables = c("AR6", "AR6_NGFS"), interactive = TRUE)
  ```

## Installation

For installation of the most recent package version an additional repository has to be added in R:

```r
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", pik = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages"))
```
The additional repository can be made available permanently by adding the line above to a file called `.Rprofile` stored in the home folder of your system (`Sys.glob("~")` in R returns the home directory).

After that the most recent version of the package can be installed using `install.packages`:

```r 
install.packages("piamInterfaces")
```

Package updates can be installed using `update.packages` (make sure that the additional repository has been added before running that command):

```r 
update.packages()
```
